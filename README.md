# cuda-convnet

High-performance C++/CUDA implementation of abstract convolutional neural networks.

This is an export of the **cuda-convnet** project, which was previously hosted
on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/), with some cleanups for
readability.

## Contributing

This is an export of the project listed above, with some cleanups for better
readability, but I do not plan to develop it further, and as such, I am not
looking to accept any contributions at this time.

Rather than getting this project to work as-is (which would mean having to
migrate it to newer versions of Python, CUDA, etc.), and resolving various
compatibility issues with decade-old software, I am reimplementing this and
other ML papers in [another project][reimplementing] if you would like to follow
along.

If you would like to continue the development of this project, please feel free
to fork it.
