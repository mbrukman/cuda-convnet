#summary How to compile the code.

= Required libraries =

For starters, you need a modern 64-bit Linux system. Here's what I hope to be a complete list of prerequisite libraries. Please [mailto:akrizhevsky@gmail.com email me] if I'm wrong.

|| *Library* || *Ubuntu package name* || *Fedora package name* ||
|| Python development libraries/headers || python-dev || python-devel || 
|| Numpy || python-numpy || numpy ||
|| Python libmagic bindings || python-magic || python-magic ||
|| ATLAS development libraries/headers || libatlas-base-dev || atlas-devel ||

And of course you also need to install the CUDA toolkit and CUDA SDK (ideally versions 4.0 of both).

= Checking out the code =

You can check out the code from trunk with this line:

{{{
svn checkout http://cuda-convnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cuda-convnet-read-only
}}}

= Compiling =

In the main directory, you'll find the [http://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/source/browse/trunk/build.sh build.sh] file. Fill in the environment variables in that file (the included defaults are their proper values on *my* system, but almost certainly not on yours).

Then, type
{{{
./build.sh
}}}

If all goes well, in a few minutes the compilation will finish successfully. [mailto:akrizhevsky@gmail.com Email me] in case of trouble.
