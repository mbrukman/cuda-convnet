#summary How to compile the code.

= Required libraries =

Here's what I hope to be a complete list of prerequisites. Please email me if I'm wrong.

I'll list them by their package names in Ubuntu.

  * python-dev
  * python-numpy
  * python-magic
  * libblas-dev

And of course you also need to install the CUDA toolkit and CUDA SDK (ideally versions 4.0 of both).

= Checking out the code =

You can check out the code from trunk with this line:

{{{
svn checkout http://cuda-convnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cuda-convnet-read-only
}}}

= Compiling =

In the main directory, you'll find the `build.sh` file. Fill in the environment variables in that file (the included defaults are their proper values on *my* system, but almost certainly not on yours).

Then, type
{{{
./build.sh
}}}

If all goes well, in a few minutes the compilation will finish successfully. Email me in case of trouble.
