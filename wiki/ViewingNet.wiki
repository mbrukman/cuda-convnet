#summary How to look inside the checkpoints saved by the net.

= Introduction =

Included with this code is a very basic script called [http://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/source/browse/trunk/shownet.py shownet.py]. Given a saved checkpoint as input, it has two functions: to plot the training/test error over time and to draw the first-layer filters that the neural net learned.

This script requires the [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ matplotlib] python library (package name `python-matplotlib` in Ubuntu and Fedora).

As mentioned above, the [http://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/source/browse/trunk/shownet.py shownet.py] has two functions, which I will demonstrate by example.


  # *Plotting the cost function*
  To plot the evolution of the value of some cost function over time, call the script like this:

  {{{
  python shownet.py -f /storage2/tmp/ConvNet__2011-08-24_16.49.31 -e logprob
  }}}

  The parameter to -f is the checkpoint location (which is printed out repeatedly by `convnet.py` during training); the parameter to -e is the name that we gave to the cost function in the layer configuration file (see LayerParams).

  You should see output that looks something like this:

  which plots the training and test error over time.

  # *Viewing learned filters*
  To view the filters that
